 *  A stream is a continuous flow of data. A stream is a way of sequentially accessing a file. A byte stream access the file byte by byte. A byte stream is
 * suitable for any kind of file, however not quite appropriate for text files. For example, if the file is using a
 * unicode encoding and a character is represented with two bytes, the byte stream will treat these separately and you
 * will need to do the conversion yourself.
